# Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction
We are building a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. 
For this use case, we are using Logistic Regression Model for our prediction. 
We will be doing our Python Programming in Google Colaboratory.
Google Colaboratory is a cloud based system in which we can write our Python script.
Logistic Regression Model works really well for bianary classification problem.
